### COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS
www.onthesnow.com
##### As soon as you land on the page, your attention is immediately drawn to the heading, ‘Want to go skiing?’ situated at the top. Just below, a search bar is placed, allowing you to input the resort or region of your choice. The overall design of the website is consistent with a minimalist aesthetic. When scrolling down, you find information on the current inches of snow at various resorts, along with the latest ski news. It was very user friendly and functional, having everything you need on the front page. The URL is the same in terms of minimalism. While inspecting the website code, I noticed <iframe> which I wasn’t familiar with, but I found that it is related to a third-party services or scripts which makes me realize it is related to an ad. A lot of the code is scripts with links to different pages of the website.

##### With snow forecast you have the first thing on the page being to choose a country and choose a resort. You have some headings under and then a link to an article right after about a new film about Snowsports. After that there is a snow forecast map, but it’s kind of blurry. There is also snow news, photos, and country ski resort overviews. The overall design of the website is predominantly red and blue. Personally, I find it somewhat cluttered, and the color combination doesn’t strike me as aesthetically pleasing. The URL is straightforward without any ‘?’ or ‘hastag’. As for the website code, it’s extensive with elements like ‘window.googletag’ and ‘add.EventListener’ that I don’t understand. I recognized code like ‘<div class =”forecast-popup” style=”border:..’ as being a container for a forecast popup.

##### This is an e-commerce website that features a variety of outdoor gear, including bikes, snowboards, skis, etc. The first thing I was drawn to on this website was the phrase ‘New Year, New Gear,’ which was followed by a ‘Shop Now’ button. The overall design includes colors like dark blue, light blue, and yellow which look good together. As you scroll through the website, options emerge for selecting from categories like winter running gear, winter biking gear, snow and ski equipment, etc. Additionally, a list of featured brands is available on the site. The URL is the same as the others in terms of simplicity. While I recognized the majority of the website code, there was one unfamiliar element following the ‘<!DOCTYPE html>’. It was a series of <!—[if 1t IE 7]> declarations or declarations that were similar just interchanging numbers. After further research I’m still slightly confused of what this means.

### GITHUB REPOSITORY RESEARCH
##### The first GitHub repository I explored was a simple weather website developed purely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The README was short but sweet, explaining what code was used and its function. It also provided a preview of the website along with a link to said website. In the HTML structure I came across elements such as the <meta> tag, which I was unfamiliar with. After further research I discovered that the <meta> tag is used to specify the character set, page description, keywords, authorship of the document, and viewport settings. The website itself incorporates a search bar for specifying the desired location. It also displays the temperature in Celsius, sky clarity, humidity levels, and windspeed. These are all elements that would be used for my own website. 

##### The second GitHub repository I explored was a clean and modern weather app. The README section presented an overview of the app’s interface with instructions on cloning the repository and installing dependencies. The README also included the usage of the code. The languages used in this repository are HTML, JavaScript, and SCSS. I was unfamiliar with what SCSS was in comparison to CSS, but after further research I found that SCSS is a superset of CSS that provides additional features that aren’t available in CSS. The design of this web app was what I was most interested in. The aesthetic was clean and modern with easy navigation—the qualities I hope to incorporate with my own website. 
### PROJECT OVERVIEW
##### My project is to build a snow sport-based web application that can provide weather data that is relevant to the needs of a skier or snowboarder. My current phase is a prototype that is not on par with its functionality.
### PAGE DESCRIPTION
##### Right now, the conceptual aspect of my page is to maintain the theme of snow sports from the home page and focus on providing information about various ski resorts on the other. The technical aspects is the continued use of HTML, implementing of a bootstrap table, using CSS for styles, and JavaScript to include user interactivity.
### FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
##### For future enhancement in respect to front-end I would like to be able to implement user profiles and allow users to save their favorite resorts. I want to also be able to create an interactive forecast for each resort, including hourly weather data and snow conditions. I would also possibly like to add live webcam feeds from different resorts if possible. On the back-end side I would be able to set up a database to store the user profiles and be able to integrate a weather API to get the real-time forecasts. Additional pages I would like to implement would be the user dashboard, weather insights, and possibly events and news for snow sports.

#### For this assignment I used generative AI with the following prompt:
##### My button is showing up on my webpage, but nothing happens when I click it, can you look at the code provided and explain to me what I did wrong (and then I provided my JavaScript and html code).

##### For this assignment I also used generative AI to put my paragraphs into it to check for grammatical errors.

### REFLECTIONS ON RESOURCES
##### Using generative AI is helpful for me in terms of checking for grammatical mistakes in my writing as well as checking for errors in my code. Most of the time, however, when I give it my code to check for errors it does not give me the right answer on how to fix it, but I think it helps a lot for me to be able to get on the right path towards fixing my mistakes. The use of W3 schools really helped me with being able to comprehend the material further, especially because it has a lot of opportunities to try the material yourself. I feel I learn best when I do examples. In lectures it is also best for me to work along as you lecture so I’m able to comprehend as best as I can.
